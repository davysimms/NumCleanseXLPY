# Spreadsheet NumCleanseXLPY

## Overview

Spreadsheet NumCleanse is a Python-based data cleansing algorithm designed to process and cleanse large volumes of numerical data stored in spreadsheets. It specializes in handling numerical data, applying advanced data cleansing techniques, and aggregating the data on a daily basis to calculate mean, maximum, and minimum values.

## Features

- **High-Volume Processing:** The algorithm is optimized to efficiently handle a significant number of spreadsheets (typically up to 10,000), making it suitable for large-scale data processing tasks.

- **Data Cleansing:** Spreadsheet NumCleanse identifies and addresses various data inconsistencies commonly found in numerical datasets, such as missing values, outliers, and formatting discrepancies.

- **Daily Aggregation:** The algorithm aggregates the cleansed data on a daily basis, providing daily mean, maximum, and minimum values, enabling users to observe trends and patterns over time.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can customize parameters to adapt the algorithm to different types of datasets and data cleansing requirements.

- **Efficient Sorting:** The cleansed data is automatically sorted, making it easier to analyze and visualize trends across various time frames.
